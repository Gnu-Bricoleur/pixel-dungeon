Extended Pixel Dungeon
=============

Another fork from Watabou's classic Pixel Dungeon https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon
Since this is a die and retry, you end up spending waaayyy more time in the 5 first floors than in the following ones.
This fork aims to extend the content available to make the experience in the first floors more diverse and interesting.
